## Introduction

NutriTrack is a backend API that enables:

- Management of personal user profiles
- Logging of daily meals and ingredients
- Meal planning and grocery list generation
- Tracking of nutritional goals (BMI, calories, etc.)

---

## System Requirements

- **Node.js** v16.0+
- **NPM** v7.0+
- **MySQL** v8.0+
- **Java JDK 21** (for SonarQube)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerization)

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/ngs/team_06/project.git
cd project/src
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up the database

Import the SQL schema:
```bash
src/db.sql
```
Update your DB credentials in src/db/connection.js:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=nutritrack
```

### 4. Start the application
```bash
npm start
```

To run in development mode with hot reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Database Configuration

NutriTrack uses a normalized MySQL schema with the following core tables:

- **Users**
userId, name, bmi, dietaryRestrictions, caloricGoal

- **Meals**

mealId, name, instructions

- **Ingredients**

ingredientId, name, unit

- **FoodLogs**

foodLogId, userId, date, mealsLogged

- **Meal_Ingredients**

mealId, ingredientId, quantity

 SQL schema and example seed data are located in:
 ```bash
src/db.sql
```
