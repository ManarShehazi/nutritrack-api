# No-Code Report

## Introduction
The **NutriTrack** application is designed to help users manage their dietary needs by tracking meals, generating shopping lists, and logging food intake. This experiment aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing core functionalities using a no-code platform like Airtable, as opposed to traditional full-code development. The goal was to evaluate the efficiency, flexibility, and limitations of no-code tools in replicating essential features of the application.

## Adaptations
To align with the no-code approach, the following adaptations were made:

- **Data Modeling in Airtable**: Tables were created for `Users`, `Meals`, `Food Log`, `Meal Plans`, `Ingredients`, and `Shopping Lists`, replicating the class structure.
- **Relationships**: Linked fields were used to model relationships between users, meals, and logs.
- **Automations**: Configured to send email notifications when a new food log entry is created.
- **Dashboards**: Implemented summary views with charts to visualize meal logs and caloric intake.

Below is the adapted class diagram:

## Features
### 1. **Database Structure**
Airtable was used to structure the application's core data entities. The `Food Log` table stores meal tracking information, linked to the `Users` and `Meals` tables.

### 2. **Automations for Email Notifications**
An automation workflow was implemented to send emails when a new record is added to `Food Log`.

### 3. **Dashboard & Visualizations**
Airtable's dashboard tools were utilized to create charts summarizing meal logs and dietary data.

### 4. **Form-based Data Entry**
Forms were created to allow users to log meals in a structured manner.

## Comparison
### **Full-Code vs. No-Code**
| Aspect | Full-Code | No-Code (Airtable) |
|--------|----------|--------------------|
| **Setup Time** | Requires coding, database setup | Quick setup with templates |
| **Customization** | Fully customizable | Limited customization options |
| **Scalability** | Can scale with optimized backend | Limited for complex workflows |
| **Automations** | Requires scripting | Built-in automation tools |
| **Data Relationships** | Complex SQL queries possible | Limited linking between tables |
| **User Interface** | Fully customizable UI | Predefined UI views |

### **Observations**
- No-code tools allowed rapid prototyping but had **limited flexibility** in data relationships and UI design.
- Full-code solutions offer greater control, especially for complex logic and integrations.
- No-code was effective for basic CRUD operations and simple automations.

## Conclusion
The no-code implementation of NutriTrack demonstrated the **ease of rapid development** and **integration capabilities** of platforms like Airtable. While useful for **small-scale applications**, its limitations in **scalability, customization, and complex logic handling** suggest that full-code development is necessary for more **robust, scalable applications**. No-code platforms are best suited for **early-stage prototypes, non-technical teams, and simple workflow automation**, whereas full-code is preferable for **performance-intensive, highly customized solutions**.
